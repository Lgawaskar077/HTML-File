    <h2 align="center">Story 1: The Honest Woodcutter></h2>
    Once there was a poor woodcutter who lived near a forest. One day, while cutting a tree near the river,
            his axe slipped from his hand and fell into the water. He sat down and cried. A fairy appeared and asked
            him what happened. She brought out a golden axe, then a silver axe, but the woodcutter said both were not his.
            Finally, she brought the iron axe, and he happily accepted it. The fairy rewarded him for his honesty.

        <p>
            On a hot summer day, a thirsty crow flew here and there in search of water. At last, it saw a pot with little
            water in it. The crow tried to drink but could not reach the water. Then it had an idea. It dropped small
            stones into the pot. The water level rose, and the crow drank the water happily.

    <h2 align="center">Story 3: The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
        <p>
            A lion was sleeping in the forest when a mouse ran over his body. The lion woke up and caught the mouse.
            The mouse begged for mercy and promised to help the lion someday. The lion laughed and let it go.
            Later, the lion was caught in a net. The mouse came and cut the net with its sharp teeth and saved the lion.
            The lion learned that even small friends can be helpful.
